# Portfolio-Webpage
Hi, glad you found my Portfolio Github page. Here you will find all the source code and files for my Portfolio webpage.
You will also be able to find previous versions of my webpage to see my progression in learning HTML and css.



Things that need to be done (in order)

# Create an about me page (front page)
# Create a page for portfolio progress
# Create a page for my past and current projects
# Create a project item for my projects page
# Buy a domain to host my portfolio webpage
# Create a hobbies page

My main focus at the moment is creating a nice looking webpage that targets desktop users.
