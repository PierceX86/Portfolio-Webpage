<!--
This is my first time actively trying to learn HTML & CSS. I have had a little experience with it in the past but nothing outside of beginner knowledge.
I don't really plan on having this be a finished project, but rather somewhere I can test my ideas and what I learn over time.
For that reason, I believe that this will make a good place to make my portfolio as it will grow with me.
The purpose of this is to prove to future employers that I am extremely capable of learning things at a fast rate especially in the IT department which is constantly growing and changing.
